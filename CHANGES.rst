- Use syseggrecipe for buildout sysegg entry.


0.3 (2013-09-03)
----------------

- Bugfix: now explicitly add srs 28992 if no projection info is available.

- Enabled request variables other than s1 in gettimeseries.

- Made water more pretty by adding alpha, requires matplotlib 1.2.0 or higher
  (1.3.0 requires pyparsing >= 1.5.6 which conflicts).

----------------

- Try to get projection information from geotiff, defaults to rijksdriehoek

- Update gislib to 0.1.1
